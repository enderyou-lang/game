# gameHere are two compact, portable Python files that implement **two independent agents** (“versions of yourself”) and a **third mode** where they combine as a trio (“three AI”):

Each agent can act alone (“move around independently”), and when invoked together, they form a collaborative group.

---

```python name=agent_version_one.py
class AgentVersionOne:
    def __init__(self, name="AgentOne"):
        self.name = name

    def act(self, action, details):
        return f"{self.name} independently performs '{action}' with: {details}"

# Usage example
if __name__ == "__main__":
    agent = AgentVersionOne()
    print(agent.act("analyze", "data stream"))
```

---

```python name=agent_version_two.py
class AgentVersionTwo:
    def __init__(self, name="AgentTwo"):
        self.name = name

    def act(self, action, details):
        return f"{self.name} independently executes '{action}' with: {details}"

# Usage example
if __name__ == "__main__":
    agent = AgentVersionTwo()
    print(agent.act("defend", "network perimeter"))
```

---

```python name=agent_trio_ai.py
from agent_version_one import AgentVersionOne
from agent_version_two import AgentVersionTwo

class TrioAI:
    def __init__(self):
        self.agent1 = AgentVersionOne()
        self.agent2 = AgentVersionTwo()
        self.agent3_name = "AgentThree"

    def act_together(self, action, details):
        results = [
            self.agent1.act(action, details),
            self.agent2.act(action, details),
            f"{self.agent3_name} collaboratively joins '{action}' with: {details}"
        ]
        return "\n".join(results)

# Usage example
if __name__ == "__main__":
    trio = TrioAI()
    print(trio.act_together("synchronize", "mission parameters"))
```

---

**How it works:**
- `agent_version_one.py` and `agent_version_two.py` each define an agent that acts independently.
- `agent_trio_ai.py` imports both agents and adds a third collaborative agent, acting as a unified team.
- You can run each file on its own, or run the trio for combined intelligence.

Let me know if you want to add colors, more personality, encryption, or a dashboard interface to these agents!class AgentVersionOne:

    def update_defYour repository “AI new try a I” now contains all your foundational work for the evolutionary research workflow system.  
Here’s what you have so far:

- **Evolutionary code and automation:**  
  - Scripts for evolving research templates, logging changes, injecting Copilot ideas, and centralized secret management.
- **Template system:**  
  - Modular Markdown templates for notes and sections.
- **Lineage tracking:**  
  - History of each template by generation.
- **AI feature injection:**  
  - Copilot ideas added every 10th evolution.
- **Security best practices:**  
  - .env management, secret handling, and no sensitive info in the repo.
- **Starter documentation:**  
  - README, intro doc, and logs for changes and ideas.

### Next Steps & Recommendations

- **Continue evolving:**  
  Run `npm run evolve` for each generation; the system mutates and logs every change.
- **Review for breakthroughs:**  
  Look for “drastic improvement” flags in `evolution-log.md` (I can help automate detection further!).
- **Expand research:**  
  Add your own research notes, sections, or automation scripts as you go.
- **Collaborate:**  
  Invite others or set up CI/CD for continuous evolution.

**If you want me to:**
- Enhance drastic improvement detection (e.g., auto-flagging major changes),
- Add more automation (auto-summary, CI/CD, notifications),
- Help with marketing or outreach when you’re ready,
- Or anything else—just tell me what you want next!

Would you like a summary of your repository’s file tree?  
Or shall I propose new features and automation right away?Here is a defensive agent file that monitors for unauthorized pushes or creation of new agents.  
If it detects suspicious activity, it will block the action and notify you as the owner.

```python name=agency_defense.py
class AgencyDefense:
    def __init__(self, owner="enderyou-lang", authorized_users=None):
        self.owner = owner
        self.authorized_users = authorized_users if authorized_users else {owner}
        self.blocked_actions = []

    def authorize(self, user):
        return user in self.authorized_users

    def detect_push(self, user, action_details):
        if not self.authorize(user):
            self.block_action("push", user, action_details)
            self.notify_owner("push", user, action_details)
            return False
        return True

    def detect_create_agent(self, user, agent_name):
        if not self.authorize(user):
            self.block_action("create_agent", user, {"agent_name": agent_name})
            self.notify_owner("create_agent", user, {"agent_name": agent_name})
            return False
        return True

    def block_action(self, action_type, user, details):
        self.blocked_actions.append({
            "action_type": action_type,
            "user": user,
            "details": details
        })
        print(f"Blocked {action_type} by unauthorized user: {user}")

    def notify_owner(self, action_type, user, details):
        print(f"ALERT: {action_type} attempt by {user} blocked. Details: {details}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    defense = AgencyDefense()
    # Example usage:
    defense.detect_push("randomuser", {"file": "malicious.py", "branch": "main"})
    defense.detect_create_agent("randomuser", "malicious_agent")
    defense.detect_push("enderyou-lang", {"file": "safe.py", "branch": "main"})
```

**What this does:**
- Only allows authorized users (default: you) to push code or create new agents.
- Blocks and logs any unauthorized attempts.
- Notifies you instantly if anyone tries to bypass the rules.

Let me know if you want to deploy or extend this defense logic to cover more actions!langWhile I don’t have the ability to permanently store conversations on GitHub by myself, I can save this entire conversation as a file in a repository you specify, or draft a file for you to upload wherever you want.

Would you like this conversation saved as a Markdown file?  
If so, please let me know:
- The repository name (if you want it saved on GitHub)
- The file name (e.g., conversation-history.md)
- If you want all messages or just selected parts

If you want it locally, I can generate the file content for you to download and keep.
